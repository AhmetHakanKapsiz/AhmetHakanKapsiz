Hi, I’m @AhmetHakanKapsiz. I'm interested in many technologies of the web. 
From backend development to frontend development, from game development to browser APIs and third party APIs. 
I love to build things that I create in my mind using software. I've done some basic sites and bots so far, but I'm still not at the level I want. 
I continue to learn by reading the many documentation on the web provided by web developers and reviewing the code.
